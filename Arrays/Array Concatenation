class Solution {
    public int[] getConcatenation(int[] nums) {
        int[] result = new int[nums.length * 2];
        for (int i = 0; i < result.length; i++) {
            result[i] = nums[i % nums.length];
        }
        return result;        
    }
}


In this loop, each element of the result array is calculated based on the values in the nums array. The loop iterates through each index of the result array, from 0 to result.length - 1.

The expression i % nums.length calculates the remainder of i divided by the length of the nums array. This is used to cycle through the nums array repeatedly as necessary.
The value of nums[i % nums.length] retrieves the element from the nums array at the calculated index.
The retrieved value is assigned to the corresponding index in the result array.
Essentially, this loop takes care of the concatenation logic by copying elements from the nums array to the result array, repeating the elements of the nums array as needed to achieve the desired length of nums.length * 2.
